## Full-stack Architecture

Every web or mobile app has two (2) parts:
|Front End|Backend  |
|--|--|
| Runs on Client <br> Serves as the UI, what the user <br> sees and interacts with | Runs on Server <br> Where we store and process <br> data, send notifications, pick <br> up workflows, etc.  
React|C#/ASP.NET <br> JavaScript/Node + Express <br> Firebase

These two parts communicate with one another using the http protocol. React is a front-end library.
