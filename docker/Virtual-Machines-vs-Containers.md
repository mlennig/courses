# Virtual Machines vs Containers

|Container|Virtual Machines|
|--|--|
| An isolated environment for running <br> an application. | An abstraction of a machine (physical hardware). |
| 1. Allow running multiple apps in <br> isolation. <br> 2. Are lightweight. They don't need <br> a full OS. <br> 3. Use OS of the host. Therefore <br> we only need to license, monitor, <br> and patch one OS. <br> 4. Starts quickly. <br> 5. Need fewer hardware resources.  | Can run an application in isolation on a virutal <br> machine.|
|  | Problems: <br> 1. Each VM needs a full-blow OS <br> 2. Slow to start (entire OS has to <br> be started. <br> 3. Resource intensive. Each VM <br> takes a slice of the actual, physical <br> hardware resources like CPU, <br> memory, and disk space.   |


### Hypervisor
A hypervisor is software we use to create and manage virtual machines. 
1. VirtualBox
2. VMware
3. Hyper-v (Windows only)
